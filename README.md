# Description
This project enables you to get movie results as you type in search box , it offers you to add movies to the favourites section and you can also delete them.
I used fetch to call the OMDb API ,I used useEffect to respond to changes when a user types in the search bar , useState to store the daynamic data such as the movies in the favourites section that can change as a user interacts with it  ,I also used the local storage to save the list of movies added to the favourites section.
